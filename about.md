Blockbench IO plugin for pckstudio-mod propdumps.

This plugin is mainly focused on importing, editing and exporting BOX
properties.

- To get started, create a new model with the format or import an existing TSV
  file.
- You can export the model as a propdump using the `File > Export` action or
  with the `Save Model` action.
- You can then import the resulting TSV into pckstudio-mod by right-clicking
  an existing skin and selecting `Import > Import property dump`.

Raw property import/export in TSV is a feature only available in [my fork of
PCK Studio](https://github.com/wily-coyote/PCK-Studio), which is what this
plugin is built around.
